            <h3>For example, say you were looking for the Hell in a Cell match with Rikishi. 
                You know the stipulation and a participant, so click both of those buttons below, 
                and text input fields will appear. Enter "Hell in a Cell" in the stipulations field 
                and "Rikishi" in the performers field. Hit enter on your keyboard after typing each 
                term or click the "Add" button. You will see the search terms appear below, and the 
                text inputs will clear. You can add more peformers (say, Kurt Angle, for example) or 
                other search parameters if necessary. If you make a mistake or want to remove a search 
                term, simply click the "x" next to the term. Since Rikishi only participated in one 
                Hell in a Cell match, we will only receive one result. If instead we had searched 
                for "The Undertaker" we would have received a list of each Hell in a Cell match 
                that The Undertaker participated in.</h3>
